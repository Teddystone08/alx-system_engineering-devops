# Application server


## Background Context


Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that you installed in your first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.

## Requirements:

Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01. The checker will connect to your servers.
Install the net-tools package on your server: sudo apt install -y net-tools
Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server.
Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000.
Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code).
